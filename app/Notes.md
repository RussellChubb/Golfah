# Notes / To Do

## To Do

* Refactor out all of the utils bs
* Recreate the Data_Loader.py file
* Create a navbar.py file
* Work out how I did the page routing for Optix and implement here

## Notes

I think as far as core features for this I'd like to be able to do the following:

1) Have an app that allows me to log my stats while I'm playing, and provides automatically calculated round totals. Once I'm finished with the round, I'm then able to log those stats back to some kind of cloud db (*even just pushing to a .csv file somewhere?*)

2) I'd then like to be able to see statistics at a couple of levels:

* Round Total Level (*Stats for every single round I've ever played*)
* The ability to click through the round to a score-sheet where I can see stats about specific holes in the round.

### Play

This page is where you're able to start a round. You're able to select a course etc.

### Home

The home-page displays some high level information about what Golfah actually is (*Perhaps with a YouTube video in there?*)

## Review

This is the statistics page, where you're able to see those two levels of tracking with the ability to click through on the round to see individual hole level performance.
